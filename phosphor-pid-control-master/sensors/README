# HostSensor

A HostSensor object is one whose value is received from the host over IPMI (or
some other mechanism).  These sensors create dbus objects in the following
namespace:
        /xyz/openbmc_projects/extsensors/{namespace}/{sensorname}

You can update them by setting the Value in Sensor.Value as a set or update
property dbus call.

# SensorManager

There is a SensorManager object whose job is to hold all the sensors.

# PluggableSensor

The PluggableSensor is an object that receives a reader and writer and is
therefore meant to be used for a variety of sensor types that aren't
HostSensors.
