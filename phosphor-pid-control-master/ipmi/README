This holds the source for the library we install to handle the manual control
OEM IPMI command.

The command is a simple series of bytes:
[0] = Subcommand, Get(0) or Set(1), Get(2) for fail-safe mode.
[1] = ZoneId
[2] = Value if Set

If Value == 1, then ManualMode is True and enabled, otherwise it's in normal
mode.

If Value == 1 (and Subcommand == 2), Failsafe mode is enabled, otherwise it's
not.
